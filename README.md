# Angel$IX
Discord bot for my friends server.

**Mostly usable as of >= v2.2.2, Music Cog needs improvment**

# TO-DOs:

-Add ytdl playlist support (might happen but its not a heavily requested/used feature).

~~-Support py-cord > 2.0.0b4 (currently py-cord 2.0.0b4 is supported but anything newer wont work).~~ This has been fixed in V2.2 [RC1]


# Planned Changes by 2.3.0:

-Fix and optimize first time setup AKA .env file setup

-Add some sort of logging to the bot. currently it just displays Ascii art, configured channels and API latency

-Better (Mobile friendly Ascii art) *We may just use a custom banner/GIF*
