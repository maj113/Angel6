# Angel$IX
Discord bot for my friends server.

**Mostly usable as of >= v2.2.2, ~~Music Cog needs improvment~~**

# TO-DOs:

- Add ytdl playlist support (might happen but its not a heavily requested/used feature).

- ~~Support py-cord > 2.0.0b4 (currently py-cord 2.0.0b4 is supported but anything newer wont work).~~ This has been fixed in V2.2 [RC1]


# Planned Changes by 2.4.0:

- [x] Fix and optimize first time setup AKA .env file setup

- [ ] Add some sort of logging to the bot. currently it just displays Ascii art, configured channels and API latency

- [ ] Better (Mobile friendly Ascii art) *We may just use a custom banner/GIF*
